Learnings:
- Basics of React (components, state, hooks etc)
- Use Create React App template
- Use GitHub for source control
- Create stubbed API data for local development.
- Use AWS Amplify to auto-deploy when code pushed to GitHub
- Use DynamoDB to store dynamic data for your app (included intro to roles and users)
- Use AWS Lambda to call out to DynamoDb and return data
- Use AWS API Gateway to map routes to AWS Lambda functions
- Call out from application to API Gateway endpoints to use dynamic data in React App


Overall Thoughts: </br>
A very good intro to AWS and React. Brett's teaching style suited my learning style and I found the "Challenges" were a great way to stay engaged throughout the course. I would highly recommend this course to those interested in developing AWS Cloud-hosted applications.
